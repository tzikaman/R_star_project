# R_star_project
Implementation of R*-Tree for manipulating spatial data 

This is a project implementing the R*-Tree, a secondary memory data structure essential
for storing and manipulating spatial and generally multidimensional data.

More specifically the whole data structure is saved in files simulating the secondary memory.
It supports insert, delete and bottom-up bulk loading and some types of queries (range, k-NN, skyline).
